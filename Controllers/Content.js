The medieval structure in Delhi holds significance even today as the Prime Minister of India makes his customary Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the fort on August 15. The fort stood at the eastern edge of Shahjahanabad, the new capital of Mughal Empire created by Shah Jehan in 17th century. Shahjahanabad was the seventh Delhi created since Indraprastha, the capital of Pandavas. Built by Shah Jehan as his residence, the fort gets its name from the massive wall of red sandstone. The Red Fort was called the “Qila-i-Mubarak” or “The blessed fort”; however, it is popularly known as ‘Lal Qila’. Though the Agra fort made of red sandstone is also called Lal Qila, it is the fort at Delhi which is associated with the name. Architecture of the fort, its planning and beauty showcases the ingenuity of Mughals and their love for creating masterpieces in stone. Though the fort has lost its glory and looks rather forlorn, it was the centre-stage of political happenings. The pomp and power of the fort was on display each Friday, when Emperor Shah Jahan paraded out of the fort at the head of his retinue atop an elephant, to offer prayers at the Jama Masjid. The fort shot into limelight again and became the epicentre of political developments during the Revolt of 1857. It was the residence of the Mughals till the last royal Bahadur Shah Zafar was arrested for his role in the mutiny. The fort was the scene of an important event associate with the Indian freedom struggle. The joint court-martial of officers of Subhash Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army – Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shah Nawaz Khan – was held at the Red Fort."

The feature finalized set for Python 3.11 has been finalized with a beta version reachable for testing. Developers are inspired to try their hands on this latest non-production code to ensure that it works well with your programs and to get an overview of whether the code you are working on will get advantage from its performance enrichments. Python function calls also require less overhead in Python 3.11. Stack frames for function call now use less memory and are more efficiently designed. Also, while recursive calls aren’t tail-optimized (which probably isn’t possible in Python, anyway), they are more efficient than in previous versions. The Python interpreter itself also starts faster, and core modules needed for the Python runtime are stored and loaded more efficiently. According to the official Python benchmark suite, Python 3.11 runs around 1.25 times faster than version 3.10. Note that this speedup is an aggregate measure: some things are much faster, but many others are only slightly faster or about the same. Still, the best part about these improvements is that they come for free. You don’t need to make any code changes for Python programs to take advantage of 3.11’s speedups. According to the news, the performance advancements are accomplished only by gaining the advantage of Faster CPython- a Microsoft-funded, smartly developed project. Faster CPython has the default interpreter known as ‘CPython’. This interpreter adopts just-in-time compiler technology and finds out the code that can be advantageous from this special and smart solution. This grants instructions in executed code objects to be framed with a new instruction. The new instruction is executed faster. This, after all, makes all of Python run faster."

AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision. They can learn from prior data or experience which helps them generate predictions to execute future tasks and actions. This does not bottleneck their capabilities and it is possible for machines to surpass human intelligence. Humans learn through memory while machines learn through data. Although the human brain does possess a unique capacity and we can memorize or recall facts and data, for large data or time-span it is not so reliable. It is possible to develop a machine through AI and machine learning with a larger memory capacity so that it can accumulate more data, which can provide us with reliable information and correct data even for longer time spans. AI experts agree that we're still in the early days of teaching systems to deeply reason, with a few examples of progress in narrow applications such as self-driving cars and select professions. Much work remains to reach a level of efficiency that allows for scaling reasoning capabilities across a broader swath of applications. There has been a 14x increase in the number of active AI startups since 2000. Thanks to recent advances in deep learning, AI is already powering search engines, online translators, virtual assistants, and numerous marketing and sales decisions."
