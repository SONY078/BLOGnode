The medieval structure in Delhi holds significance even today as the Prime Minister of India makes his customary Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the fort on August 15. The fort stood at the eastern edge of Shahjahanabad, the new capital of Mughal Empire created by Shah Jehan in 17th century. Shahjahanabad was the seventh Delhi created since Indraprastha, the capital of Pandavas. Built by Shah Jehan as his residence, the fort gets its name from the massive wall of red sandstone. The Red Fort was called the “Qila-i-Mubarak” or “The blessed fort”; however, it is popularly known as ‘Lal Qila’. Though the Agra fort made of red sandstone is also called Lal Qila, it is the fort at Delhi which is associated with the name. Architecture of the fort, its planning and beauty showcases the ingenuity of Mughals and their love for creating masterpieces in stone. Though the fort has lost its glory and looks rather forlorn, it was the centre-stage of political happenings. The pomp and power of the fort was on display each Friday, when Emperor Shah Jahan paraded out of the fort at the head of his retinue atop an elephant, to offer prayers at the Jama Masjid. The fort shot into limelight again and became the epicentre of political developments during the Revolt of 1857. It was the residence of the Mughals till the last royal Bahadur Shah Zafar was arrested for his role in the mutiny. The fort was the scene of an important event associate with the Indian freedom struggle. The joint court-martial of officers of Subhash Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army – Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shah Nawaz Khan – was held at the Red Fort."

The feature finalized set for Python 3.11 has been finalized with a beta version reachable for testing. Developers are inspired to try their hands on this latest non-production code to ensure that it works well with your programs and to get an overview of whether the code you are working on will get advantage from its performance enrichments. Python function calls also require less overhead in Python 3.11. Stack frames for function call now use less memory and are more efficiently designed. Also, while recursive calls aren’t tail-optimized (which probably isn’t possible in Python, anyway), they are more efficient than in previous versions. The Python interpreter itself also starts faster, and core modules needed for the Python runtime are stored and loaded more efficiently. According to the official Python benchmark suite, Python 3.11 runs around 1.25 times faster than version 3.10. Note that this speedup is an aggregate measure: some things are much faster, but many others are only slightly faster or about the same. Still, the best part about these improvements is that they come for free. You don’t need to make any code changes for Python programs to take advantage of 3.11’s speedups. According to the news, the performance advancements are accomplished only by gaining the advantage of Faster CPython- a Microsoft-funded, smartly developed project. Faster CPython has the default interpreter known as ‘CPython’. This interpreter adopts just-in-time compiler technology and finds out the code that can be advantageous from this special and smart solution. This grants instructions in executed code objects to be framed with a new instruction. The new instruction is executed faster. This, after all, makes all of Python run faster."

AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision. They can learn from prior data or experience which helps them generate predictions to execute future tasks and actions. This does not bottleneck their capabilities and it is possible for machines to surpass human intelligence. Humans learn through memory while machines learn through data. Although the human brain does possess a unique capacity and we can memorize or recall facts and data, for large data or time-span it is not so reliable. It is possible to develop a machine through AI and machine learning with a larger memory capacity so that it can accumulate more data, which can provide us with reliable information and correct data even for longer time spans. AI experts agree that we're still in the early days of teaching systems to deeply reason, with a few examples of progress in narrow applications such as self-driving cars and select professions. Much work remains to reach a level of efficiency that allows for scaling reasoning capabilities across a broader swath of applications. There has been a 14x increase in the number of active AI startups since 2000. Thanks to recent advances in deep learning, AI is already powering search engines, online translators, virtual assistants, and numerous marketing and sales decisions."

The decision by K-pop sensations, BTS, to take a hiatus is breaking hearts globally. But, unlike the Beatles or One Direction, their decision is tied to Korean peninsula politics and the challenge of balancing national security and South Korea’s soft power ambitions. The seven members of BTS broke the news during their annual dinner, which was streamed live to fans worldwide on June 15, citing exhaustion and a desire to pursue solo projects. Some confusion arose afterwards when, in a bid to slow their tumbling stock price, the band’s entertainment company, Hybe, said BTS would continue to work both together and individually. However, discerning fans suspect the decision is more calculated than suggested, speculating that some BTS members will soon be fulfilling their military service duties. The split comes just weeks after an intense political debate in South Korea over whether the group’s members should be exempt from South Korea’s compulsory military service requirement."

Titled 'Joining the BTS Army', the write-up talked about the journey of superband BTS but did not give due credit to K-pop groups SHINee and BIGBANG which irked the netizens. The journalist Tammy Kim mentioned the unfortunate suicide of Kim Jonghyun, a member of SHINee, and that BTS participated in a UNICEF campaign to combat violence against children and teens. The article talked about many other K-pop idols but not in a good way. Angry fans called out the journalist and claimed that Jonghyun was a much higher artist and deserved to be respected in the write-up. Soon after, 'Tammy Kim Apologise' started trending on social media. Fans pointed out that in an attempt to praise BTS, the writer belittled other K-pop idols and overlooked the growth of the K-pop industry even before BTS. One Twitter user said, 'First of all, Kim Jonghyun is much more than a suicide case. If you are going to write about him, then let it be about his legacy as an artist. It’s unnecessary to specifically correlate BTS’s UNICEF campaign to his passing.' Another tweeted, 'while jonghyun was using his platform to get korean laws changed, bring attention to israeli occupation, call out discrimination towards transgender people, you’re out here disrespecting him to get a few clicks.'"

For this reason, numerous studies have shown significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness after incorporating battle rope exercises for as little as 10 minutes per session. What's more, one study showed that battle rope exercises significantly increase heart rate and are classified as vigorous activity. This can burn a high volume of calories in a short time frame while strengthening your heart. Battle rope exercises can be a good option for people who have lower body injuries or prefer low impact workouts. Most traditional battle rope exercises require your feet to be planted on the floor.

Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage. For example, sitting in a chair all day results in tight hamstrings in the back of the thigh. That can make it harder to extend your leg or straighten your knee all the way, which inhibits walking. Likewise, when tight muscles are suddenly called on for a strenuous activity that stretches them, such as playing tennis, they may become damaged from suddenly being stretched. Injured muscles may not be strong enough to support the joints, which can lead to joint injury.`

            Are you someone who loves eating desserts after elaborate desi meals, then these simple tricks will help manage sugar even after eating sweets. Sugar intake directly impacts your calorie count and weight, this is the reason why most experts suggest avoiding refined sugar or desserts made with refined sugar. But here are some expert suggested ways to manage the calories after eating a dessert.
            2/5 | What you eat is important?
            Yes, eating desserts is not an issue, but what exactly you eat and how much you eat decides the fate of your diet. If you crave desserts or sweets after the meals, make sure you include a small portion and do not exceed more than 100 calories. To manage a healthy calorie count of 1400-2000 calories a day. As per a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) only six to 10 percent of our daily calories should come from sugar, which is around 120 to 200 calories if you are following a daily intake of 2,000 calories to manage a healthy weight. Thus, portion control is essential.
            ​3/5 | Detox drinks
            Drinking a detox drink after meals like ginger tea, green tea, fennel tea or black tea with herbs can help in cutting down the excess calorie intake by accelerating the metabolic rate, which further helps in burning the fat molecules during the process of digestion.
            4/5 | Quick walk
            This is a simple way to manage sugar levels even when you are eating healthy. Walk for 10-15 minutes after the meals, this helps in burning the excess calories, boost metabolism and helps in gradual release of sugar in the bloodstream.
            5/5 | Choose healthier alternative
            Even if you feel like indulging in a sweet treat make sure you stick to something that’s healthy. If you are suffering from diabetes, taking 2-3 dates or raisins or a small piece of jaggery or dark chocolate can help in satiating those sugar cravings in a much healthier way!

            "information":`Call it ‘Okra’, ‘Bhindi’ or ‘Lady’s Finger’, this humble vegetable is a summer favourite. It is biologically classified as a fruit but frequently used as a vegetable. Many people might not know this, but Bhindi is packed with an impressive nutritional profile. It is low in carbs and loaded with vitamin C and K1. Also, okra is one of the lesser-known vegetables that has protein in it as compared to the other vegetables. It is also rich in antioxidants and contains a thick gel-like substance, which is known as ‘mucilage’. It is what makes okra slimy and sticky. This substance makes it difficult for the okra to cook and even cut. So, if you are looking forward to making this humble vegetable at home this season, here are some of the tips that you must keep in mind.
            1/5 | The selection
            Though this vegetable can be found around the year, okra grows in abundance from May to September. While choosing this vegetable, make sure that the pods are small and crisp and can break from the centre, and avoid the ones with brown spots or blemishes.
            2/5 | The chopping tricks
            Have you ever realised that when you wash the okra and cut it right before cooking, it turns slimier? Well, it is because water enhances the sliminess and thus one should never wash the okra right before cooking it. When you wash the Bhindi, let it sit at room temperature before starting to chop. It is always best to cut large chunks rather than thin slices. The lesser surface area you will have, the less mucilage will escape.
            ​3/5 | Reducing the sliminess
            There are 2 ways to reduce the sliminess. The first, is to freeze the okra and cut it while it is still frozen. This way you will realise that the okra is less slimier than when you cut it fresh. Another trick for reducing that sliminess is to soak the okra in vinegar for half an hour before cooking it. Before cooking, rinse and pat dry.
            4/5 | The right cooking method
            It is not easy to cook okra as it can turn mushy and slimier easily. Thus, it is suggested to cook it at high heat, which helps in eliminating a lot of the slime. Grilling and sauteing are the best ways to cook okra, as it helps in reducing mucilage. Just make sure that you never cover the okra with a pan, as the steam will make it slimier.
            5/5 | Add salt to the end
            It is a known fact that salt can produce moisture in a vegetable, so it is always better to add salt at the end of the cooking process when the Bhindi is almost cooked.`

The fruit is sour when a bit raw and turns sweeter as it ripens. In India, Karonda is mostly grown in the Konkan region of Maharashtra and Goa and even in areas of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. Want to add some extra sourness to your chutney? Add a handful of Karondas to it. To make green mint chutney, add 1 cup coriander leaves, ¼ cup mint leaves, ¼ cup karondas, 5 garlic cloves, 2 green chillies, ½ onion, ½ tsp roasted cumin seeds and salt as per taste to a blender. Grind everything to form a smooth paste. Your lip-smacking chutney is ready to be served. Another easy way to include the goodness of Karonda in your diet is by adding some to your sabzi. Karonda can be added to any kind of dry sabzi like aloo gobhi, bhindi masala, mixed veg etc. Just cut the Karonda in half, remove the seed and chop it into small pieces. Add them while cooking the sabzi, depending on how sour you want the sabzi to be. Karondas are naturally soft in texture and require very less cooking time."

This is due to the umpteen health benefits of this fruit, which is loaded with vitamin A, C, minerals and antioxidants. But do you know this common fruit can also turn toxic and fatal if consumed with one food. Here’s all you need to know about papaya and its dangerous effects.
            ​What makes papaya so good?
            It is full of nutrients like dietary fiber, protein, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins C, A, E, B, minerals and antioxidants like alpha and beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin that help in cell regeneration and reduce the oxidative stress.

Here are some other precautions one needs to keep in mind while consuming papaya.

            "information":`The concept of Sushi originated from Japan and has now reached India. In the past few years, this Japanese delicacy has formed its own fan base in India. With over 100 Japanese restaurants in India serving this dish of seafood wrapped up with vinegar flavoured rice - sushi is truly a blessing in form of food and one shouldn’t miss out on this beautiful and delicious experience. Eating sushi is an art in itself and if you are new to the world of sushi, you are probably confused from where to begin with. Don’t worry we got you covered. Here are the dos and don’ts that will help you ace the sushi game.
            Use wasabi carefully
            Wasabi sauce might add taste to your bite but one needs to be very careful while dipping their sushi into the fiery hot paste. DO: Use just a bit of it on your first go, if you think you can handle the spice, level up on your next bite. DON’T: Do not get excited about it and smother the whole thing at the very first bite!
            How to use ginger on the side
            Ginger is served along with the sauces and wasabi in the form of a palate cleanser. DO: Have a little bit of ginger from time to time while going for the next variety. DON’T: Do not place the ginger on top of your sushi before putting it in your mouth.
            Remember this while dipping your sushi into soy sauce
            Extra soy sauce tends to mess up with flavours of the sushi, one just needs wee little bit of it to go with their sushi. DO: You are supposed to dip your sushi for a second into the soy sauce DON’T: You are not supposed to drown your sushi into the soy sauce. DO: Dip the fish side of your sushi into soy sauce, this side needs the flavour DON’T: Do not dip the rice side of your sushi, ever. The rice side is flavoured and spiced up and it doesn’t need soy sauce to flavour it up.
            How to use chopsticks
            Before going out to the sushi place, make sure you’ve watched plenty of ‘HOW TO USE CHOPSTICKS’ tutorials and have practised well at home first to avoid the judgey looks of people at the restaurant. DO: While taking out the sushi for yourself, use the backends of your chopsticks and not the one that you are putting in your mouth. DON’T: Don’t rub your chopsticks together to remove the wooden splinters. It looks rude, just trust the sushi place for handing out good quality chopsticks.`
